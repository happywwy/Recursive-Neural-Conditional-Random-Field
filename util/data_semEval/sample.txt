Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip
Avoid this place
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good
Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world
The wine list is interesting and has many good values
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan
I was very disappointed with this restaurant
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested
Food was okay, nothing great
Chow fun was dry pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family
I we will never go back to this place again
Went on a NUM day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great
Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat
You can't go wrong here
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street
Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
Can't wait wait for my next visit
I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try'
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back
The food is very averagethe Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt)
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari
The decor is night thobut they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceilingits quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing
What's the difference between the two
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share
We went around NUM on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great
we love th pink pony
THe perfect spot
Food - awesome
Service - friendly and attentive
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience
(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood)
the food is decent
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, ie make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
I had a great experience
Food is great
Service is top notch
I have been going back again and again
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency - not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
The rice to fish ration was also good - they didn't try to overpack the rice
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd
The food was well prepared and the service impecable
I'm going back
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality)
I will be going back and heartily recommend it
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood
It is terrific, as is the value
NUM and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison
Go hungry and enjoy
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not
The kitchen however, is almost always slow
Also, specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you don't
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best
Just went here for my girlfriends NUM bday
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro
This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair
The food was average to above-average the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week
IT WAS HORRIBLE
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn
The pizza is overpriced and soggy
Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right
A big disappointment, all around
